# Hugo Workflow

![alt text](src/client/assets/images/hugologo.jpeg "Hugo workflow")

This is a workflow to create a static website based on the Hugo framework (https://gohugo.io/).

## Hugo's elevator pitch

Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

## About hugo-workflow

I wanted to create a workflow based on gulp to allow me to create static websites fast.
I also wanted to see changes (HTML, markup, SCSS, JS and server) rendered automatically on the browser without the need of a refresh.

## How to use it

- **npm run clean** *(Cleans the build folder)*
- **npm run build** *(Builds the website)*
- **npm run optimize** *(Optimizes the website prior to deployment)*
- **npm run prep** *(Builds the website in dist mode and optimizes the build for deployment)*
- **npm run deploy** *(Deploys to Amazon's S3)*
